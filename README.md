# deepForest
A simple header-based deep forest classifier library for C++-17 (or newer)

Currently in the early stages of construction, does not contain any functions or methods.

The goal of this library is to contain a simple implementation of weighted Random Forest as well as [Deep Forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07366) optimized for the size of models stored on the drive as well as voting time.

Heavily inspired by https://github.com/malaschitz/randomForest
